# Undo Functionality Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
Implement the undo option that the categoriesscreen list view has but on the mainscreen linkitem swipe to delete.

## Implementation Overview
Successfully implemented undo functionality for MainScreen link deletion, mirroring the existing CategoriesScreen implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. MainViewModel.kt
- **Added imports**: `Job`, `delay`, `asStateFlow` for undo functionality
- **Added state variables**:
  - `_snackbarState`: Manages snackbar visibility and messages
  - `_pendingDeletions`: Tracks links pending deletion (hidden from UI)
  - `deletedLink`: Stores the deleted link for potential undo
  - `deleteJob`: Manages the delayed deletion coroutine

- **Modified `deleteLink()` method**:
  - Now adds link to pending deletions instead of immediate deletion
  - Shows snackbar with "Link deleted" message and undo option
  - Schedules actual deletion after 5-second delay
  - Cancels any existing delete job before starting new one

- **Added new methods**:
  - `undoDelete()`: Cancels deletion, removes from pending deletions, hides snackbar
  - `hideSnackbar()`: Manually hides the snackbar

- **Updated links flow**: Now filters out links that are in pending deletions

- **Added SnackbarState sealed class**: `Hidden` and `Visible(message, linkName)` states

### 2. MainScreen.kt
- **Added imports**: `SnackbarHost`, `SnackbarHostState`
- **Added snackbar state handling**:
  - Collects snackbar state from ViewModel
  - Uses `LaunchedEffect` to handle snackbar visibility and user actions
  - Handles "Undo" button clicks and snackbar dismissals

- **Added SnackbarHost to Scaffold**: Displays the snackbar with undo option

- **Modified swipe-to-delete behavior**:
  - Changed `confirmValueChange` to return `false` instead of `true`
  - Added `LaunchedEffect` to reset dismiss state after swipe action
  - Now triggers undo flow instead of immediate dismissal

### 3. LinkUndoFunctionalityTest.kt
Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- Links are added to pending deletions and snackbar is shown
- Links are not immediately deleted (delayed deletion)
- Undo functionality works correctly
- Links are eventually deleted after delay
- Snackbar can be manually hidden

## User Experience Flow
1. User swipes link to delete (EndToStart direction)
2. Link is hidden from UI (added to pending deletions)
3. Snackbar appears with "Link deleted" message and "Undo" button
4. User can either:
   - Click "Undo" → Link is restored, snackbar disappears
   - Dismiss snackbar or wait 5 seconds → Link is permanently deleted

## Testing Results
- ✅ All existing tests still pass (7/7)
- ✅ All new undo functionality tests pass (5/5)
- ✅ Total: 12/12 tests passing
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors

## Architecture Consistency
The implementation follows the same patterns as the existing CategoriesScreen undo functionality:
- Same state management approach
- Same UI patterns and components
- Same timing (5-second delay)
- Same user interaction flow
- Consistent with MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture principles

## Key Features
- **Non-destructive deletion**: Links are hidden but not immediately deleted
- **5-second grace period**: Users have time to undo accidental deletions
- **Visual feedback**: Clear snackbar message with undo action
- **Consistent UX**: Matches the existing categories undo behavior
- **Robust error handling**: Proper cleanup on errors or cancellation
- **Comprehensive testing**: Full test coverage for all scenarios
