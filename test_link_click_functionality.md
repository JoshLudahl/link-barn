# Test Link Click Functionality

## Manual Testing Steps

To verify that the link click tracking and dashboard functionality works correctly:

### 1. Setup Test Data
1. Launch the app
2. Add a few test links using the "+" button:
   - Name: "Google", URL: "https://www.google.com"
   - Name: "GitHub", URL: "https://www.github.com"
   - Name: "Stack Overflow", URL: "https://stackoverflow.com"

### 2. Test Link Clicking
1. From the main screen, click on each of the test links
2. Verify that each link opens in the browser
3. Return to the app after each click

### 3. Test Dashboard Display
1. Navigate to the Dashboard screen (using the dashboard icon in the top bar)
2. Verify that the dashboard shows:
   - "Clicked Links Dashboard" title
   - Statistics showing total clicks and unique links clicked
   - Grid view of clicked links with proper formatting
   - Each clicked link should display as a card with name and URL

### 4. Test Empty State
1. If no links have been clicked, verify the empty state message:
   - "No links clicked yet"
   - "Click on links from the main screen to see them here"

### 5. Test Grid Layout
1. Click multiple links to populate the dashboard
2. Verify that links are displayed in a responsive grid layout
3. Verify that clicking on a link card in the dashboard opens the link in browser

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Link clicks are recorded in the database
- ✅ Dashboard displays clicked links in a grid view
- ✅ Statistics are updated correctly
- ✅ Empty state is handled properly
- ✅ Grid layout is responsive and user-friendly

## Database Verification

The implementation includes:
- ClickedLink entity with proper Room annotations
- ClickedLinkDao with necessary database operations
- ClickedLinkRepository for data access
- Database migration (MIGRATION_2_3) to create clicked_links table
- Proper dependency injection setup

## Code Changes Summary

1. **Database Layer**: Added ClickedLink entity, DAO, and repository
2. **UI Layer**: Created DashboardViewModel and updated DashboardScreen
3. **Business Logic**: Modified MainViewModel to record link clicks
4. **Dependency Injection**: Updated AppModule with new dependencies
5. **Database Migration**: Added migration to create clicked_links table
